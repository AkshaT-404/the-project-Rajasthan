        <p class="Introduction-1">Gogaji Fair is celebrated in the memory of Gogaji who was believed as a snake king.
            Gogaji also is known as Jahar Veer Gogga who was a folk idol of Rajasthan in India.

            He was a warrior-hero of the region, recognized as a saint and a ‘snake-god’. Gogaji or Jahar Pir, one of
            the snake-kings, and a Chauhan Rajput had an empire near Ganganagar in Rajasthan.
            The fair is inspired by the worship of Gogaji which starts in the Bhaadra month of Hindu calendar. The
            majestic fair of Gogaji is held at his birthplace and Samadhi sthala which is called as Gogamedi. Gogamedi
            is located in a quiet a far distance from Jaipur, in the Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan.

            It is believed that Gogaji went into samadhi at Gogamedi. Thousands of followers gather to pay homage at
            this memorial place every year in the month of Bhadra which falls between August and September during the
            Gogaji fair, which lasts for 3 days.

            The fair is held from the ninth day of the dark half of Bhadra popularly known as Goga Navami to the
            eleventh day of the dark half of the same month. The inscription in Persian at the main entrance describes
            Mahmud of Ghazni’s regard for Gogaji.

            It is quite a sight to see people singing and dancing to the beats of drums and gongs with multicolored
            flags called marks in their hands.

            The songs and bhajans on the life history of Gogaji are recited accompanied by music played with traditional
            instruments like Damru, Chimta, in the fair which attract a mass number of listeners. At his birthplace
            Dadrewa the fair goes for over a month.

            It is a common sight to see people with snakes lying around their necks. It is common belief among devotees
            that Gogaji will protect them from snakes. According to a folklore in and around his birthplace Dadrewa it
            is believed that if someone picks up even a stick from johra (which is a barren land which has a sacred pond
            in Dadrewa, it would turn into a snake.

            Devotees of Gogaji worship him when they get a snake bite and apply sacred ash or bhabhoot on the bite as an
            instant medicine.</p>
