        <p class="Introduction-1">The capital and largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan is Jaipur (Hindi:
            Jayapura), historically known
            as Jeypore. The city was the eighth most populous in the nation in 2022 with a population of 4.5 million.
            Because of the predominately pink colour scheme of its buildings, Jaipur is sometimes referred to as the
            "Pink City." It is sometimes referred to as the Paris of India and was dubbed the Isle of Glory by C. V.
            Raman. It is 268 kilometres (167 miles) from New Delhi, the nation's capital. The city of Jaipur was
            established in 1727 by Jai Singh II, the lord of Amer and a Kachhwaha Rajput. Vidyadhar Bhattacharya was the
            architect of one of modern India's first planned towns.

        <p class="Introduction-1"> Together with Delhi and Agra, Jaipur is a well-known tourist attraction in India and
            is a component of the
            west Golden Triangle tourism route (240 km, 149 mi). It also acts as a gateway to other popular tourist
            attractions in Rajasthan, including Jodhpur (348 kilometres, 216 miles), Jaisalmer (571 kilometres, 355
            miles), Bharatpur (186 kilometres, 116 miles), Udaipur (421 kilometres, 262 miles), Kota (252 kilometres,
            156 miles), and Mount Abu (520 km, 323 mi).
        </p>


        <p class="Introduction-1">The "Pink City of India," Jaipur, was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites
            on July 6, 2019. The UNESCO World Heritage Sites Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar are both located in the city.

                <p class="Introduction-9">The city of Jaipur was built by the King of Amber, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II
                    on
                    18 November 1727, who reigned from 1699 to 1743. He wanted to transfer his capital from Amber, 11
                    kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to meet the expanding population and increasing shortage of water. Jai
                    Singh
                    examined various books on architecture and architects when creating the layout of Jaipur. Vastu and
                    Shilpa Shastra were used in the architectural planning of Jaipur under the direction of architect
                    Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. Major streets, buildings, and palaces required four years to build after the
                    city's development started in 1726. The architectural Renaissance of the 17th century, which
                    occurred in
                    Northern India during Mughal control, had a significant impact on the city's architecture. As a
                    result,
                    a lot of it has an architectural style that is typical of the Muslim world. The city was divided
                    into
                    nine blocks, two of which housed the palaces and state buildings while the other seven were
                    designated
                    for the general population. Seven fortified gateways were erected into enormous ramparts.
                </p>

                <p class="Introduction-9">In order to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (who would subsequently
                    become King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876, Sawai Ram Singh I had the city painted pink.
                    Many of
                    the streets are still covered in pink paint, giving Jaipur its distinctive appearance and the
                    nickname
                    "Pink City."
                </p>

                <p class="Introduction-9">The city had remarkable growth in the 19th century, and by 1900, there were
                    160,000 people living there. Wide boulevards were paved, and its primary industries—supported by an
                    art school established in 1868—were the fabrication of metals and the carving of marble. Three
                    colleges were located in the city, including a Sanskrit college founded in 1865 and a ladies' school
                    established in 1867 under Maharaja Ram Singh II.
                </p>


                <p class="Introduction-9">Large areas of the city including the airport were flooded in August 1981,
                    resulting in the death of eight people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River. The
                    floods were caused by three days of cloud burst that produced more rain than the annual average.

            <p class="Introduction-1">India's Golden Triangle includes Jaipur, a popular tourist destination.
                Jaipur came in at
                number seven on the list of greatest tourist destinations in Asia in the 2008 Conde Nast
                Traveller Readers Choice Poll. Jaipur came in first place among all Indian locations for the
                year in the 2015 Traveller's Choice Awards for Destination. In CNN's 2012 list of the top 15
                most expensive hotel suites in the world, the Presidential Suite of the Raj Palace Hotel, which
                costs $45,000 a night, came in second.

                instruments
                remarkable at their time.) and Amer Fort are one of the World Heritage Sites. Hawa Mahal is a
                five-storey pyramidal shaped monument with 953 windows that rises 15 metres (50 ft) from its high
                base. Sisodiya Rani Bagh and Kanak Vrindavan are the major parks in Jaipur. Raj Mandir is a notable
                cinema hall in Jaipur.
