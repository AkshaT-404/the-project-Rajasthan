        <p class="Introduction-1">The capital of the Rajput kings, Jodhpur, historically known as Marwar, has a rich
            history of customs that are being practised today.

            This city, the second largest in the state of Rajasthan, is situated on the western side of the state
            capital of Jaipur. This Rajasthani city, which is home to majestic forts, ancient temples, and royal
            palaces, is a well-known tourist attraction in both the country and the state. Jodhpur, which is situated in
            the desolate Thar Desert, has bright, sunny weather all year round. The city is also known as "Sun City"
            because of this. One of this large city's unique features is that practically all the homes built around the
            Mehrangarh fort are painted in blue color, due to which the city is even known as the "Blue City".
        </p>
        <p class="Introduction-1">Jodhpur is a colourful city. It throbs with the romance, beauty, glory and warmth of a
            populous desert city which has stood testimony to civil wars, love affairs, intrigues and a display of power
            and wealth. The traditional folk dance and music performances, which are held at night, are great
            attractions to the visitors.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-4">HISTORY</h1>

            <p class="Introduction-1">Rao Jodha, a Rathore clan Rajput lord, built the city of Jodhpur in 1459. By
                successfully capturing the surrounding lands, Jodha established a kingdom that became known as Marwar.
                Mandore, a neighbouring town where Jodha was born, was initially the state's capital, but Jodhpur
                gradually took over that function, even during Jodha's lifetime. The city was situated along the
                important route between Gujarat and Delhi. This allowed it to benefit from a thriving commerce in
                tradeable items including dates, sandalwood, opium, copper, silk, and other commodities.
            </p>

            <p class="Introduction-1">After India gained its independence in 1947, the state and the union united,
                making Jodhpur Rajasthan's second-largest city. Hanwant Singh, the monarch of Jodhpur, first opposed
                joining India at the time of division, but eventually, thanks to Vallabhbhai Patel's persuasive
                arguments, Jodhpur was admitted to the Indian Republic. It was eventually included into the state of
                Rajasthan under the State Reorganisation Act of 1956.

            <h3 class="heading-4">TOURISM</h3>

            <p class="Introduction-1">The Mehrangarh Fort, which has a panoramic view of the city, as well as the blue
                alleyways of the ancient city, Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jaswant Thada, and the Ghanta Ghar, or Clock Tower,
                are among Jodhpur's top tourist destinations. Mandore Garden, Kaylana Lake and Garden, Balsamand Lake,
                Machia Biological Park, Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park, Ratanada Ganesh Temple, Toorji Ka Jhalra, Sardar
                Samand Lake and Palace, Masooria Hills, Veer Durgadas Smarak (monument, park, and museum), Surpura Dam,
                and Bhim Bhadak Cave are also nearby attractions for tourists. Food, antique, traditional clothing, and
                traditional shoes markets (also known as Jodhpuri Mojari) are held in Jodhpur and draw crowds as well.
                Murals depicting ascetics in yoga positions and paintings with inscriptional records of the dignitaries
                visiting the shrine, including Charanas, nobles, and the Rajas, can be found in Mahamandira, a temple
                dedicated to Sri Jalandharnath.
