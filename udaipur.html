            Udaipur was founded in 1553 by Maharana Udai Singh II as the new capital of Mewar Kingdom. It is located in
            the fertile, circular Girwa Valley to the southwest of Nagda, which was the first capital of Mewar.

        <p class="Introduction-9">Maharana Udai Singh II established Udaipur in 1559 on the Banas River's lush Girwa
            Valley, southwest of Nagda. The city was chosen to serve as the Mewar kingdom's new capital. Ayad, a wealthy
            commercial town that had served as Mewar's capital from the 10th to the 12th century, was already present in
            this region. As a result, Chittaud kings were already familiar with the Girwa region and frequently
            relocated there whenever an enemy onslaught threatened the nearby tableland of Chittaurgarh. After the
            development of artillery warfare in the 16th century, Rana Udai Singh II made the decision, while in exile
            in Kumbhalgarh, to relocate his capital to a more secure site. Ayad was prone to flooding, so he picked the
            ridge east of Pichola Lake to establish his new capital city. While hunting in the Aravalli Range foothills,
            he stumbled into a hermit. According to the legend, the hermit gave the king his blessing and instructed him
            to erect a palace there, telling him that it would be well-defended. On the spot, Udai Singh II subsequently
            built a house. Chittor was subdued by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in November 1567. Rana Udai Singh constructed
            a six-kilometer city wall with seven gates, including Surajpole, Chandpole, Udiapole, Hathipole, Ambapole,
            Brahmpole, Delhi Gate, and Kishanpole, to defend his domain from invasion. The ancient city or walled city
            still refers to the territory enclosed by these walls and gates. Akbar personally travelled to Udaipur in
            September 1576 and stayed there for six months, from May 1577 to September 1576. Rana Amar Singh
            acknowledged vassalage to Mughal control under Emperor Jahangir in 1615, and Udaipur remained the state's
            capital until 1818, when it was elevated to the status of a princely state of British India. Despite
            considerable pressure, Udaipur was able to resist Mughal influence because it is a hilly area and is not
            ideal for horses that are fully armoured. Maharana Mahendra Singh Mewar is now the 76th heir apparent of the
            Mewar family.
