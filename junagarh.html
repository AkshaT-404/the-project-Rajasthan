        <p class="Introduction-1">Before the present Junagarh Fort was built, an old stone fort existed in the city.
            This fort was built in 1478 by Rao Bika who established the city of Bikaner in 1472. Rao Bika was the second
            son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the Rathor clan, the founder of Jodhpur city. He conquered the large arid lands
            to the northern region of Rajasthan to set up his domain. As the second son of Jodha he had no chance of
            inheriting his father's territory of Jodhpur or to the title of Maharaja. He, therefore, reconciled and
            decided to build his own kingdom at Bikaner at the place then called "Jungladesh". Bikaner, though a partly
            of the Thar Desert, was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast
            since it had adequate spring water sources. Bika's name was thus tagged to the Bikaner city as well as to
            the then state of Bikaner ("the settlement of Bika") that he established. The history of Bikaner and the
            fort within it thus start with Bika. It was only about 100 years later that Bikaner's fortunes
            flourished under Raja Rai Singhji, the sixth ruler of Bikaner, who ruled from 1571 to 1611. During the
            Mughal Empire’s rule in the country, he accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals and held a high position of
            an army general in the court of Emperor Akbar and his son Emperor Jahangir. His successful war exploits by
            way of winning half of Mewar kingdom won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was gifted
            the jagirs (lands) of Gujarat and Burhanpur. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the
            Junagarh fort on a plain land, which has an average elevation of 760 feet (230 m). The formal foundation
            ceremony for the fort was held on 17 February 1589 and the fort was completed on 17 January 1594. Raja
            Rai Singhji, was an expert in arts and architecture and the knowledge that he acquired during his several
            sojourns to several countries are amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built in the Junagarh
            fort.[5][ Thus the fort, a composite structure, became an outstanding example of architecture and a unique
            centre of art, amidst the Thar desert.

            Karan Singh who ruled from 1631 to 1639, under the suzerainty of the Mughals, built the Karan Mahal palace.
            Later rulers added more floors and decorations to this Mahal. Anup Singh, who ruled from 1669–98, made
            substantial additions to the fort complex, with new palaces and the Zenana quarter (royal dwelling for
            females). He refurbished the Karan Mahal with a Diwan-i-Am (public audience hall) and called it the Anup
            Mahal. Gaj Singh who ruled from 1746 to 1787 refurbished the Chandra Mahal (the Moon palace). Following him,
            Surat Singh ruled from 1787 to 1828 and he lavishly decorated the audience hall (see picture in info box)
            with glass and lively paintwork. Dungar Singh who reigned from 1872 to 1887 built the Badal Mahal (the
            weather palace) named so in view of a painting of falling rain and clouds (a rare event in arid Bikaner).
            Ganga Singh who ruled from 1887 to 1943 built the Ganga Niwas Palace, which has towers at the entrance
            patio. This palace was designed by Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob. Ganga Singh's son Sadul Singh succeeded his
            father in 1943 but acceded to the Union of India in 1949. He died in 1950.

            Bikaner came under the suzerainty of the British Raj under a treaty of paramountcy signed in 1818,
            whereafter the Maharajas of Bikaner invested heavily on refurbishing their Junagarh fort. However, during
            the 18th century, before this treaty was signed, there was internecine war between rulers of Bikaner and
            Jodhpur and also amongst other Thakur, which was put down by the British troops.[3 It is reported that
            during the attack by Jodhpur army, of the two entrances to the fort (one in the east and the other in the
            west), the eastern entrance and the southern rampart were damaged; marks of cannonballs fired are seen on
            the southern façade of the fort.

            Ganga Singh was the best-known king among the Rajasthan princes. A favourite of the British Raj, he earned
            the title of Knight Commander of the Star of India. He served as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet,
            represented the country at the Imperial First World War Conferences and the British Empire at the Versailles
            Peace Conference and was aware of the shift of fortunes in the World War II but died in 1943, before the war
            was won by the allies. His contribution to the building activity in Junagarh involved separate halls for
            public and private audience in the Ganga Mahal and a durbar hall for formal functions. The hall where he
            held his Golden Jubilee as a ruler of Bikaner is now a museum. He also got a new palace - north of Junagarh
            fort - designed and built by Swinton, the third of the new palaces built in Bikaner and named it Lalgarh
            Palace in the name of his father and shifted his residence from Junagarh fort to this palace in 1902. The
            royal family still lives in a special suite in the Lalgarh palace, which they have converted into a heritage
            hotel.</p>
